# Vector

Welcome to vector a janet wrapper for the c++ vector library.
This is a simple library I created because when I needed a simple vector interface, tho I forgot what the reason was now.

## Installation
To install vector follow the following steps.
### Install jpm
You first need to make sure that the Janet package manager is installed on your system. 
A guide to install [jpm](https://janet-lang.org/docs/jpm.html).
### Clone the repo
Once you have jpm installed on your machine the next step is to clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/JMinyard1335/Janet-vector.git
```
### Install
Once the repo is installed move in to the directory you cloned it into and run the following commands:
```
jpm build
jpm install
```
### Use in project
at this point if there are no errors you are good to import the module into your project.
